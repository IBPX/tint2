The theme switcher made easier the management of different config file for tint2.

It'll give a preview of each config with your current setting (backgroud, size of monitor, ...), and allow to switch between tint2 config.

For now, the theme switcher doesn't work if tint2 is running with -c parameter.



= Running =

  Start the theme switcher with command `tint2conf`.

  On startup, the theme switcher show your current config file.
