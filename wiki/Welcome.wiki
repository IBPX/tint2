tint2 is a simple _*panel/taskbar*_ made for modern x window managers. It was specifically made for _*openbox3*_ but should also work with other window managers (GNOME, KDE, etc...). It's based on ttm code http://code.google.com/p/ttm/

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and compliance with freedesktop specifications.
