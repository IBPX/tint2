= tint2 doesn't show the systray/notification =
  * Check your tint2rc to see if you have 'systray = 1'
  * run tint2 in a terminal. if you get 'tint2 : another systray is running' it's because you have another systray/notification and you can't run more than one at a time. 
    * In gnome, remove the systray/notification with a right clic on the separator before your systray/notification -> remove

= why some systray icons disappeare from the panel ? =
  * tint2 made a stop/restart of systray protocol on some events (like switching theme with tint2conf). But some systray icon doesn't implement the stop/restart of the manager and disappeared from the panel. You can report the problem to us but also to the systray icon developper.

= I want to disable the tint2 systray =
  * To disable the systray, just put `systray = 0` in your tint2rc

= Tint2 doesn't work on compiz correctly? =
  * All my tasks are on one desktop in compiz?
    * This happens because compiz has by default only one workspace with 4 view ports.To fix this, Open the Compiz Settings Manager (On Ubuntu _System -> Preferences -> Advanced Desktop Effects Settings_, and then click on _General Options -> Desktop Size tab -> adjust the number of workspaces_, increase the number of workspaces to the number of desktops you want. Tint2 will behave as expected from then.
  * Tint is being decorated with a window/ has a shadow /is not fully transparent
    * Open CompizConfig Settings manager -> Window Decorations Plugin   
      * In the box for Decoration windows, put  `any & !type=dock`
      * In the box for Shadow windows, put  `any & !type=dock`
