= Tint2 doesn't work on compiz correctly? =
  * All my tasks are on one desktop in compiz?
    * This happens because compiz has by default only one workspace with 4 view ports.To fix this, Open the Compiz Settings Manager (On Ubuntu _System -> Preferences -> Advanced Desktop Effects Settings_, and then click on _General Options -> Desktop Size tab -> adjust the number of workspaces_, increase the number of workspaces to the number of desktops you want. Tint2 will behave as expected from then.
