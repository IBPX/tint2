Frequently asked questions. Please add any extra tips to the comments.

= What is tint2? =
  * Tint2 is a panel/taskbar for modern x window managers like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, openbox, pekwm,etc..

= Who is the developer of tint2 ? =
  * Main developers of tint2 are Thierry Lorthiois and Andreas Fink

= Does tint2 have a system tray/notification area? =
  * YES! Tint2 finally has system tray/notification area. Please [Install install] the latest build if your current build doesn't have it.

= I have the latest build of tint2 but still no system tray =
  * Check your tint2rc to see if you have the systray option configured and the options are not commented out.
  * The systray section looks like this 
    {{{
#---------------------------------------------
# SYSTRAYBAR
#---------------------------------------------
systray = 1
systray_padding = 0 3 3
systray_background_id = 0
systray_sort = left2right
    }}}

= tint2 doesn't show the systray/notification =
  * Check your tint2rc to see if you have 'systray = 1'
  * run tint2 in a terminal. if you get 'tint2 : another systray is running' it's because you have another systray/notification and you can't run more than one at a time. 
    * In gnome, remove the systray/notification with a right clic on the separator before your systray/notification -> remove

= Why did some systray icons disappear from the panel? =
  * tint2 stops/restarts the systray protocol on some events (like switching theme with tint2conf). But some systray icons do not implement the stop/restart of the manager and so disappear from the panel. You can report the problem to us and also to the systray icon developer.

= I want to disable the tint2 systray =
  * To disable the systray, just put `systray = 0` in your tint2rc
  * Example:
    {{{      
systray = 0
systray_padding = 0 3 3
systray_background_id = 0
     }}}

= How to configure real transparency =
  * tint2 autodetects your composite manager and uses real transparency when possible. However, xcompmgr have a little bug which prevents tint2 from detecting it. 
  * If you want autodetect with xcompmgr, download and apply xcompmgr's patch (in bug report). See <a href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26090">xcompmgr patch</a>


= Tint2 doesn't work on compiz correctly? =
  * All my tasks are on one desktop in compiz?
    * This is a known issue in compiz. Compiz doesn't support 'Virtual desktop' specification (or you have to disabled visual effect).<br>I look like 'Desktop number' use Viewport instead of 'Virtual desktop'. So pager capabilities are not supported. <br>See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/153322 <br>or http://forum.compiz.org/viewtopic.php?f=86&t=11943 <br>or  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/150690 
  * Tint is being decorated with a window/ has a shadow /is not fully transparent
    * Open CompizConfig Settings manager -> Window Decorations Plugin   
      * In the box for Decoration windows, put  `any & !type=dock`
      * In the box for Shadow windows, put  `any & !type=dock`  
   [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3284967834_51f4d5cd22.jpg]
  * Tint has ugly white streaks
    * Set a background for your desktop

= I want to disable compiz shadow on Tint2 =
  * Run ccsm the compiz configuration tool. Go to Window Decorations. For both decoration and shadow windows, replace 'any' with 'any & !name=tint2'.

= Adding a 'show desktop' button =
  * tint2 doesn't implement 'show desktop' button. But here a way to get it. <br>
Create a file with following text
     {{{      
#!/bin/sh
if wmctrl -m | grep "mode: ON"; then
exec wmctrl -k off
else
exec wmctrl -k on
fi
     }}}
Save it in /usr/bin/show_desktop.sh and make it executable.<br>
Install the package 'wmctrl'. And call the script in tint2rc config file.
     {{{      
time1_format = %H:%M
time1_font = sans 8
time2_format = %A %d %B
time2_font = sans 6
clock_font_color = #ffffff 76
clock_padding = 4 4
clock_background_id = 0
clock_lclick_command = show_desktop.sh
     }}}
Then left click on the clock will do it.

= Task list is limited =
  * In your tint2rc file, check the value of `taskbar_mode`. If it's `multi_desktop`, tint2 show one taskbar per desktop. Change the value to `single_desktop` if you want just one taskbar.

= How can I get 'pager like capability' ? =
  * In your tint2rc file, change the value of `taskbar_mode` to `multi_desktop`. This option will show one taskbar per desktop. So you can detect on witch desktop is an application and witch desktop is empty (or full). You can close an application whithout switching to the desktop. You can drag n drop application between desktop.  

= I want to hide some tasks from the panel ? =
  * In Openbox config file 'rc.xml' you can assign the property 'skip_taskbar' to your window

= How to maximize window over tint2 =
  * You can manage interaction between tint2 and window with :
    {{{      
panel_layer = bottom,normal,top
strut_policy = follow_size/minimum/none
autohide_height = integer
     }}}
  If you want maximized window never cover tint2:
    {{{      
panel_layer = top
strut_policy = follow_size
     }}}
  If you want maximized window behind tint2:
    {{{      
panel_layer = top
strut_policy = none
     }}}
  If you want maximized window behind tint2, but 2 pixels free so you can use desktop action (right click, ...):
    {{{      
panel_layer = top
strut_policy = minimum
autohide_height = 2
     }}}

= I get errors when I try to compile tint2 on my own =
  * Do you have all the dependencies installed? Please check [Install#Dependencies here]

= I upgraded to tint2 and I still have the old panel with its bugs =
  * The tint binary was renamed tint2 to avoid a conflict with another package.So your new tint2 startup command is *tint2*
  * Since a new stable release hasn't been released yet, both the old tint and the new tint2 binaries will be on your system when you upgrade just incase you run into some problems and want to fall back on the old binary.

= Tint2 don't show in Pekwm =
  * Setting the margin to one pixel made it appear on my screen. With horizontal panel:
    {{{      
panel_margin = 0 1
     }}}
  * With vertical panel:
    {{{      
panel_margin = 1 0
     }}}

= Is there an IRC channel? =
  * Yes. There is now an irc channel, *#tint2* on [irc://irc.freenode.net irc.freenode.net].
